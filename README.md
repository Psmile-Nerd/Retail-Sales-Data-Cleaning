### Project Synopsis
The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the Retail Sales Dataset by performing thorough data cleaning and preprocessing techniques. The cleaned data will enable reliable analysis, informed decision-making, and optimized business strategies for the retailÂ organization.

### Data Source
The primary dataset for this data cleaning is "Retail_Sales.xlsx" which contained necessary imformations for the sales of the year 2023.

### Tool
* Excel - Data Cleaning [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/)

### Steps in Data Cleaning
1. I began by importing and thoroughly exploring the data to gain a clear understanding of its structure and content.
2. I diligently checked for any duplicate data entries, but fortunately found none.

4.  Following this, I meticulously formatted the text, ensuring that the data types were appropriately adjusted to facilitate easy analysis.

6.  To enhance the dataset's usability, I inserted a table, making it easier to apply quick filtering, formatting, and sorting.
   
8. I converted the month to text using the specified syntax and performed data validation to ensure compliance with established rules. The formular to convert month to text is
   ```excel
   =TEXT('B2, "mmmm")
10. Finally, I grouped the data into gender categories, streamlining the use of the SUBTOTAL formula during aggregate calculations.

### Recommendations 
I recommend that Explorative Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualisation and other aspect of Data Analysis should be done on the dataset so as to unlock avaluable insight, reach a meaningful decision and propose a realistic goal for the future of the company. 

Note that: I intend to continue to the next phrase of this project
